You are given a string s made up of characters A and B. Initially you have no coins. You can perform two types of operations:

Pick a substring AB, change it to BC, and get a coin.
Pick a substring BA, change it to CB, and get a coin. 

What is the most number of coins you can obtain?

A substring of length 2 is a sequence of two adjacent characters of a string.

input

8
ABBA
ABA
BAABA
ABB
AAAAAAB
BABA
B
AAA

output

2
1
3
1
6
2
0
0

in the first test case you can perform the following operations to get 2 coins:

ABBA -> BCBA -> BCCB

in your code for the input AAAAAAB you get 1
but it can be 6 beacause AAAAAAB -> AAAAABC -> AAAABCC -> AAABCCC -> AABCCCC -> ABCCCCC -> BCCCCCC
