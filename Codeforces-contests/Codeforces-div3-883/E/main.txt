One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.

He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:

    Initially, the graph has only one vertex.
    Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k

new vertices (k>1).
Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. 

The smallest possible snowflake for k=4 is shown in the figure.

After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices. Help Rudolf check if a snowflake with n

vertices can exist.
Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t
(1≤t≤10^4) — the number of test cases.

Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n
(1≤n≤10^6) — the number of vertices for which it is necessary to check the existence of a snowflake.
Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case — "YES" if there exists such k>1
for which a snowflake with the given number of vertices can be constructed; "NO" otherwise.
