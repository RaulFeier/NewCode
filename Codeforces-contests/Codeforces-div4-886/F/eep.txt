Mihai and Slavic were looking at a group of n frogs, numbered from 1 to n, all initially located at point 0. Frog i has a hop length of ai.

Each second, frog i hops a[i] units forward. Before any frogs start hopping, Slavic and Mihai can place exactly one trap in a coordinate in order to catch all frogs that will ever pass through the corresponding coordinate.

However, the children can't go far away from their home so they can only place a trap in the first n
points (that is, in a point with a coordinate between 1 and n) and the children can't place a trap in point 0 since they are scared of frogs.

Can you help Slavic and Mihai find out what is the maximum number of frogs they can catch using a trap?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t
(1≤t≤100) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n
(1≤n≤2⋅10^5) — the number of frogs.

The second line of each test case contains n
integers a[1],…,an (1≤a[i]≤10^9) — the lengths of the hops of the corresponding frogs.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n
over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Output


For each test case output a single integer — the maximum number of frogs Slavic and Mihai can catch using a trap.

Note

In the first test case, the frogs will hop as follows:

Frog 1: 0→1→2→3→4→⋯
Frog 2: 0→2→4→6→8→⋯
Frog 3: 0→3→6→9→12→⋯
Frog 4: 0→4→8→12→16→⋯
Frog 5: 0→5→10→15→20→⋯

Therefore, if Slavic and Mihai put a trap at coordinate 4, they can catch three frogs: frogs 1, 2, and 4. It can be proven that they can't catch any more frogs.

In the second test case, Slavic and Mihai can put a trap at coordinate 2 and catch all three frogs instantly.
